            The captivating "<span class="madeRed">Game of Generals</span>,"
            is an ancient Japanese chess variant that breathes life into the
            battlefield of a <span class="madeRed">9x9 board</span>. As the
            sun casts its golden rays, two players lock horns, commanding an army
            of warriors ready to seize glory or succumb to defeat. In this
            enthralling contest, cunning strategy and lightning-fast calculations
            intertwine as players employ intricate maneuvers, deceptive traps, and
            a symphony of sacrifices to outwit their opponent. Each piece embodies
            the spirit of a legendary warrior, from noble generals to formidable
            foot soldiers, vying for <span class="madeRed">supremacy </span>
            in a game where every move echoes with history and whispers tales of
            unfathomable skill. Shogi's enigmatic beauty lies in its ability to
            blend timeless traditions with an endless realm of possibilities,
            captivating both masters of strategy and those venturing into its
            mystic realm for the first time.

          A popular variant we've been promoting known as "Goro Goro Shogi" has all of the same rules as traditional shogi, but uses a smaller board and fewer pieces (and all the pieces have cute animals on them!). Our guide to Goro Goro Shogi can be <a href="./files/gorogoro-rules.pdf" download>downloaded here</a> and you can find printouts on the <a href="./play.html">play page</a>.
